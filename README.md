## 🧠 Why Agents?

Agents are not simple chatbots.  
They **act independently**, **delegate tasks**, and **produce structured results**.

In this project, the main agent communicates with three specialized sub-agents:

### **1️⃣ Skill Evaluator Sub-Agent**
- Understands user background  
- Determines current skill level  
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses  
- Suggests appropriate starting point  

### **2️⃣ Learning Path Generator Sub-Agent**
- Designs a progressive learning roadmap  
- Breaks content into weekly modules  

### **3️⃣ Daily Study Planner Sub-Agent**
- Converts roadmap into daily actions  
- Plans tomorrow’s tasks  
- Keeps learning consistent and trackable
